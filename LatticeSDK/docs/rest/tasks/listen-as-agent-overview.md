# Listen as agent

POST https://example.developer.anduril.com/api/v1/agent/listen
Content-Type: application/json

Establishes a server streaming connection that delivers tasks to taskable agents for execution.

This method creates a persistent connection from Tasks API to an agent, allowing the server
to push tasks to the agent as they become available. The agent receives a stream of tasks that
match its selector criteria (entity IDs).

The stream delivers three types of requests:
- ExecuteRequest: Contains a new task for the agent to execute
- CancelRequest: Indicates a task should be canceled
- CompleteRequest: Indicates a task should be completed

This is the primary method for taskable agents to receive and process tasks in real-time.
Agents should maintain this connection and process incoming tasks according to their capabilities.

When an agent receives a task, it should update the task status using the UpdateStatus endpoint
to provide progress information back to Tasks API.

This is a long polling API that will block until a new task is ready for delivery. If no new task is
available then the server will hold on to your request for up to 5 minutes, after that 5 minute timeout
period you will be expected to reinitiate a new request.
